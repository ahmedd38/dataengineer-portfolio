## Introduction

In today's data-driven world, effective data engineering is crucial. This portfolio demonstrates my skills and projects that focus on data pipelines, analytics, and data warehousing. I aim to make data accessible and actionable for decision-makers.

## Technologies Used

This portfolio includes various technologies and tools, such as:

- **Apache Airflow**: For orchestrating complex workflows.
- **Python**: The primary language for scripting and automation.
- **Apache Spark**: For big data processing and analytics.
- **Dagster**: For building data pipelines.
- **ETL Processes**: Extract, Transform, Load processes for data integration.
- **Data Lakes**: Storing large volumes of structured and unstructured data.
- **Analytics**: Using notebooks for data exploration and visualization.

## Projects Overview

### 1. ETL Pipeline for E-commerce Data

This project involves building an ETL pipeline that extracts data from various sources, transforms it into a usable format, and loads it into a data warehouse.

- **Technologies**: Python, Apache Airflow, SQL
- **Key Features**:
  - Scheduled data extraction.
  - Data validation and cleansing.
  - Loading into a PostgreSQL database.

### 2. Airflow DAG for Social Media Analytics

In this project, I created an Airflow DAG to automate the collection and analysis of social media data.

- **Technologies**: Apache Airflow, Python
- **Key Features**:
  - Daily data extraction from APIs.
  - Data transformation and analysis using Pandas.
  - Automated reporting.

### 3. Notebook-Driven Analytics for Sales Data

This project utilizes Jupyter notebooks to perform exploratory data analysis on sales data.

- **Technologies**: Python, Jupyter, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Key Features**:
  - Interactive visualizations.
  - Insights into sales trends.
  - Recommendations based on data analysis.

### 4. Data Warehouse Design

I designed a data warehouse to support analytics for a retail company.

- **Technologies**: Snowflake, SQL
- **Key Features**:
  - Star schema design.
  - Efficient querying for analytics.
  - Integration with BI tools.
